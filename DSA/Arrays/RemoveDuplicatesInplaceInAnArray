problem :
  We have to remove duplicates in an array inplace by replacing in the array itself. That means first n positions it must contains the unique elements
  remaining positions can be any elements.
Brute Force:
   Intution:
           We can use linkedhashset. We can add all the elements into the hashset that will remove all duplicates.
    Time Complexity:
          O(N^2)
    Space Complexity:
          O(N) 
Optimal:
    Intution:
         We can use two pointers here. By placing i pointer at first. Again we loop using j pointer starting at 1st index.
         if(arr[i]!=arr[j])
         {
            i++;
            arr[i]=arr[j];
         }
         Time Complexity:
          O(N)
         Space Complexity:
          O(1)
