Problem   
  We have to find the maximum element in an array.
  Solution:
     Brute force :
        Intution :
             Sorting in ascending order makes the largest element move to (n-1)th index.
        Time complexity:
             O(NlogN)
        Space complexity:
              O(N)
    Optimized:
        Intution:
            Updating the max variable when there is an largest element than the previous value.
        Time complexity:
            O(N)
        Space complexity:
            O(1)
