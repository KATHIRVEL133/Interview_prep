Problem Statement:
  Given an array find whether the array is sorted or not
Solutions:
  Brute Force:
    Intution:
      starting from index i(o->n-1) check whether the current element smaller for remaining i+1 elements
    Time complexity:
      O(N*N)
    Space complexity:
      O(1)
  Optimized:
    Intution:
     Find in one traversal
     Just compare arr[i] and arr[i-1]
     if(arr[i]<arr[i-1]) return false;
    Time complexity:
      O(N)
    Space complexity:
      O(1)
