Problem statement :
   Find the second smallest and largest element in an array containing duplicate array.
Solutions:
  Brute Force:
     If the array containing not duplicate elements we can sort the array and find the answer 
     if(size>2) else return -1;
     Time Complexity:
        O(N*logN)
    Space Complexity:
        O(1)
  Better Approach:(2 traversal approach)
     Find the maximum and minimum ele from the array.
     After that again traverse the array with the condition if(arr[i]<second_small&&arr[i]!=small) 
   Time Complexity:
      O(2*N)
    Space Complexity:
      O(1)
  Optimized Approach:
     Within one traversal we can find the max and min ele 
        if(arr[i]<small)
        {
             small = arr[i];
             second_small = small;
        }
        else if(arr[i]<second_small&&arr[i]!=small)
        {
            second_small = arr[i]
        }
     Time Complexity:
       O(N)
     Space Complexity:
       O(1)
