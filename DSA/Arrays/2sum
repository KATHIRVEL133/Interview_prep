Here are the **clear and structured notes** for your given code snippet üëá

### **Problem:**

Find **two indices** in an array such that the **sum of the elements equals the target value** ‚Äî
but this time using an **optimized HashMap approach**.

This is the **efficient O(N) solution** to the *Two Sum problem*.

---

### **Intuition:**

Instead of checking all possible pairs (as in the brute force method),
we can use a **HashMap** to store elements we‚Äôve already seen,
so we can find the complement (i.e., `target - currentElement`) in **constant time**.

---

### **Approach / Steps:**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize answer array**

```java
int[] ans = new int[2];
ans[0] = ans[1] = -1;
```

This stores the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.
Initially set to `-1` to indicate that no pair is found yet.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a HashMap**

```java
HashMap<Integer, Integer> mpp = new HashMap<>();
```

The map will store each element as a **key**, and its **index** as the value.
This helps us find whether the complement (`target - num`) exists quickly.

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Traverse the Array**

For each element in the array:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    int num = arr[i];
    int moreNeeded = target - num;
```

We calculate how much more we need (`moreNeeded`) to reach the target.

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Complement Exists**

If the complement (`moreNeeded`) is already in the map,
we have found the two numbers that sum to the target:

```java
if (mpp.containsKey(moreNeeded)) {
    ans[0] = mpp.get(moreNeeded);
    ans[1] = i;
    return ans;
}
```

Here:

* `mpp.get(moreNeeded)` gives the index of the previously seen number.
* `i` is the index of the current number.

---

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Otherwise, Store Current Number**

If the complement is not found, store the current element and its index:

```java
mpp.put(arr[i], i);
```

This ensures that for future elements, this number can serve as a complement if needed.

---

#### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Return Result**

If the loop completes and no pair is found:

```java
return ans;  // still [-1, -1]
```

---

### **Example:**

**Input:**

```
arr = [2, 6, 5, 8, 11]
target = 14
```

**Execution:**

| i | arr[i] | moreNeeded | HashMap before | Found? | Action             |
| - | ------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------ | ------------------ |
| 0 | 2      | 12         | {}             | ‚ùå      | Put (2,0)          |
| 1 | 6      | 8          | {2=0}          | ‚ùå      | Put (6,1)          |
| 2 | 5      | 9          | {2=0,6=1}      | ‚ùå      | Put (5,2)          |
| 3 | 8      | 6          | {2=0,6=1,5=2}  | ‚úÖ      | Found 6 at index 1 |

‚úÖ **Output:** `[1, 3]`
(because `arr[1] + arr[3] = 6 + 8 = 14`)

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* **O(N)** ‚Üí Each element is processed once.
* Lookup and insertion in HashMap take **O(1)** on average.

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(N)** ‚Üí In the worst case, all elements are stored in the HashMap.

---

### **Key Points:**

‚úÖ Much more efficient than the brute-force method (O(N¬≤)).
‚úÖ Works on **unsorted arrays**.
‚úÖ HashMap provides **constant-time lookups** for complements.
‚ùå Returns only one valid pair (first found).

---

‚úÖ **In short:**
This optimized approach uses a **HashMap** to store visited elements and their indices,
allowing you to find the **two-sum pair in linear time (O(N))**.


Here are **well-structured notes** for your given code üëá

---

## üîπ **Problem Statement:**

You are given an array of integers and a target value.
You need to determine **if there exists a pair of numbers in the array** whose **sum equals the target**.

Return `"YES"` if such a pair exists, otherwise return `"NO"`.

---

## üîπ **Intuition:**

Instead of checking all pairs (which would take O(N¬≤)),
we can use the **two-pointer technique** on a **sorted array** to find the pair efficiently.

Sorting helps us move pointers intelligently ‚Äî
if the sum is too small, we move the **left pointer rightward** (to increase sum),
and if the sum is too large, we move the **right pointer leftward** (to decrease sum).

---

## üîπ **Step-by-Step Approach:**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort the Array**

```java
Arrays.sort(arr);
```

Sorting helps us apply the **two-pointer** approach easily.
After sorting, the smallest element is at the left and the largest at the right.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize Two Pointers**

```java
int left = 0, right = n - 1;
```

* `left` starts at the beginning (smallest element).
* `right` starts at the end (largest element).

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Iterate While `left < right`**

We keep checking the sum of elements at the two pointers:

```java
int sum = arr[left] + arr[right];
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Compare the Sum with Target**

#### ‚úÖ If `sum == target`

We found the pair ‚Äî return `"YES"` immediately:

```java
return "YES";
```

#### ‚û°Ô∏è If `sum < target`

The sum is too small, so move the **left pointer right**:

```java
left++;
```

This increases the sum since elements on the right are larger.

#### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è If `sum > target`

The sum is too large, so move the **right pointer left**:

```java
right--;
```

This decreases the sum since elements on the left are smaller.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ If Loop Ends**

If no pair is found:

```java
return "NO";
```

---

## üîπ **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**

```
arr = [2, 6, 5, 8, 11]
target = 14
```

**Sorted Array:** `[2, 5, 6, 8, 11]`

| Left | Right | arr[left] | arr[right] | Sum | Action                  |
| ---- | ----- | --------- | ---------- | --- | ----------------------- |
| 0    | 4     | 2         | 11         | 13  | Sum < target ‚Üí left++   |
| 1    | 4     | 5         | 11         | 16  | Sum > target ‚Üí right--  |
| 1    | 3     | 5         | 8          | 13  | Sum < target ‚Üí left++   |
| 2    | 3     | 6         | 8          | 14  | ‚úÖ Found! ‚Üí return "YES" |

‚úÖ **Output:** `"YES"`

---

## üîπ **Time Complexity:**

* **O(N log N)** ‚Üí Sorting the array.
* **O(N)** ‚Üí Two-pointer traversal.
* **Overall:** **O(N log N)**

## üîπ **Space Complexity:**

* **O(1)** ‚Üí Constant extra space used.

---

## üîπ **Key Takeaways:**

‚úÖ Uses **sorting + two pointers** ‚Äî an optimal approach.
‚úÖ Much faster than brute-force (O(N¬≤)).
‚úÖ Works only if **array can be sorted** (doesn‚Äôt preserve original order).
‚úÖ Efficient for checking **pair existence**, not index retrieval.

---

### üß† **Summary:**

> This solution efficiently checks if any two numbers in an array sum up to a target using the **two-pointer method** after sorting the array ‚Äî achieving **O(N log N)** time complexity.
