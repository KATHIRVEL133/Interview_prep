Here are the **structured notes** for your code:

---

### **Problem:**

Find the missing number in a sequence of first `N` natural numbers when exactly one number is missing.

---

### **Intuition:**

The sum of the first `N` natural numbers is known and can be calculated using the formula:

[
\text{Sum} = \frac{N \times (N + 1)}{2}
]

If we subtract the sum of array elements from this total sum, the result will be the missing number.

---

### **Approach / Steps:**

1. Calculate the expected sum of numbers from `1` to `N` using the formula.
2. Iterate through the array and compute the sum of its elements.
3. Subtract the array sum from the expected sum to find the missing number.
4. Return the missing number.

---

### **Example:**

**Input:**
`N = 5`,
`a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`

**Process:**

* Expected sum: ( \frac{5 \times 6}{2} = 15 )
* Array sum: ( 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12 )
* Missing number = ( 15 - 12 = 3 )

**Output:**
`3`

---

### **Time Complexity:**

**O(N)** — one pass through the array to compute the sum.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

**O(1)** — only a few variables are used regardless of input size.

---

### **Notes:**

* This method is very efficient for finding **a single missing number** in a sequence.
* Assumes array elements are **distinct** and range from `1` to `N`.
* Works best when array size is `N-1`.
* Beware of integer overflow for large `N`; in such cases, use `long` type or an alternative method like XOR.

---

If you want, I can also give you an **XOR-based method** for this problem which avoids overflow and is equally efficient.
Do you want me to?

Here are the **structured notes** for your XOR-based missing number program:

---

### **Problem:**

Find the missing number in a sequence of first `N` natural numbers when exactly one number is missing.

---

### **Intuition:**

Using the properties of XOR:

* ( x \oplus x = 0 )
* ( x \oplus 0 = x )
* XOR is **commutative** and **associative**.

If we XOR all numbers from `1` to `N` with all numbers in the array, the duplicates cancel out, leaving the missing number.

---

### **Approach / Steps:**

1. Initialize two variables `xor1` and `xor2` to 0.
2. XOR all integers from `1` to `N` into `xor1`.
3. XOR all array elements into `xor2`.
4. XOR `xor1` and `xor2`.
5. The result is the missing number.

---

### **Example:**

**Input:**
`N = 5`,
`a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`

**Process:**

* XOR from 1 to N: (1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 \oplus 5) → `xor1`.
* XOR of array: (1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 \oplus 5) → `xor2`.
* Missing number = `xor1 ⊕ xor2` → `3`.

**Output:**
`3`

---

### **Time Complexity:**

**O(N)** — one pass to XOR numbers and another pass to XOR array elements.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

**O(1)** — only a few variables are used.

---

### **Advantages over Sum Method:**

* No risk of integer overflow (unlike sum formula method for large N).
* Works in constant space and linear time.

---

### **Notes:**

* This method works only for exactly **one missing number** in a continuous sequence starting from 1.
* Requires no extra data structures.
* Very efficient and robust for large datasets.

If you want, I can now give a **comparative note between the sum method and XOR method** for missing numbers so you can clearly see when to use each.
