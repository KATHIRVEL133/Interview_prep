Here are the **structured notes** for your "Last Occurrence Search" program:

---

### **Problem:**

Find the **last occurrence index** of a given element (`key`) in an array.
If the element does not exist in the array, return `-1`.

---

### **Approach / Logic:**

1. Start scanning the array **from the end** (reverse order).
2. Compare each element with the `key`.
3. As soon as a match is found, store the index and **stop the search** (break).
4. Return the index found, or `-1` if not found.

---

### **Example:**

**Input:**
`n = 7`,
`key = 13`,
`v = {3, 4, 13, 13, 13, 20, 40}`

**Process:**

* Start from the last element and move backwards.
* First match found at index `4` (0-based index).
* Return `4`.

**Output:**
`4`

---

### **Time Complexity:**

**O(N)** — worst case requires scanning the entire array if the key is not present.

### **Space Complexity:**

**O(1)** — no extra memory used except for a few variables.

---

### **Advantages:**

* Direct approach without extra data structures.
* Efficient if the last occurrence is near the end of the array.

---

### **Disadvantages:**

* Worst case is still linear time.
* Not optimal if there are frequent searches — a hash map or binary search (sorted array) could be faster.

---

✅ **Key takeaway:**
Scanning backward is a simple and effective way to find the last occurrence of an element in an unsorted array.

---

If you want, I can now give you a **modified version that works for sorted arrays using binary search** so it finds the last occurrence in **O(log N)** time. That would make your solution much more efficient for large datasets.

Do you want me to do that?
