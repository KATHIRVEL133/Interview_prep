Here are the **structured coding notes** for your program 👇

### **Problem:**

Determine whether a **target element `k`** exists in a **rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates**.

---

### **Intuition:**

In a **rotated sorted array with duplicates**, it’s tricky to apply standard binary search directly because duplicates can make it hard to decide which half of the array is sorted.

Example:
`[3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 3]` — Here, both halves appear sorted due to duplicates.

To handle this, we use a **modified binary search** with an extra condition to skip over duplicate elements at the boundaries.

---

### **Approach / Steps:**

1. **Initialize pointers:**

   * `low = 0`, `high = n - 1`.

2. **Run a loop while `low <= high`:**

   * Compute `mid = (low + high) / 2`.
   * If `arr[mid] == k`, return **true** (target found).

3. **Handle duplicates (Edge Case):**

   * If `arr[low] == arr[mid]` and `arr[mid] == arr[high]`,
     increment `low` and decrement `high` to skip duplicates.
     Continue to the next iteration.

4. **Check which half is sorted:**

   * **Case 1: Left half is sorted (`arr[low] <= arr[mid]`)**

     * If target lies between `arr[low]` and `arr[mid]`, search left (`high = mid - 1`).
     * Otherwise, search right (`low = mid + 1`).

   * **Case 2: Right half is sorted**

     * If target lies between `arr[mid]` and `arr[high]`, search right (`low = mid + 1`).
     * Otherwise, search left (`high = mid - 1`).

5. **If loop ends without finding the element:**
   Return **false** (target not present).

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**

**Input:**
`arr = [7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `k = 3`

**Process:**

* Initially: `low = 0`, `high = 9`
* `mid = 4 → arr[mid] = 3 → Target found ✅`

**Output:**
`Target is present in the array.`

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* **O(log N)** on average — behaves like binary search.
* **O(N)** in the worst case — when duplicates force us to linearly skip elements (e.g., `[3,3,3,3,3]`).

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(1)** — constant space used.

---

### **Key Notes:**

* Handles **rotated sorted arrays with duplicates**, unlike the standard binary search.
* The **duplicate-handling step** (`if (arr[low] == arr[mid] && arr[mid] == arr[high])`) is crucial — prevents infinite loops.
* Commonly asked in interviews — an extension of **“Search in Rotated Sorted Array”** (LeetCode #33) → this version is **LeetCode #81**.
* Efficient and elegant — no need for extra data structures.

---

**In short:**
➡ This algorithm smartly combines **binary search logic** with **duplicate handling** to efficiently determine if a target exists in a rotated sorted array.
