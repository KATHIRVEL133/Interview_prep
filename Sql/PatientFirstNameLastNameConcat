Hereâ€™s a structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the **full name** of all patients from the `patients` table by concatenating the `first_name` and `last_name` columns with a space in between.

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We want a **single column** combining first and last names.
   * The `CONCAT()` function in SQL allows combining strings.
   * Use a space `' '` between names for readability.
   * Alias the result as `full_name` for clarity.

2. **Use SQL SELECT statement:**

   * `SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)` concatenates the names with a space.
   * `AS full_name` gives a meaningful name to the result column.
   * The `FROM` clause specifies the table (`patients`).

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM patients;
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* **O(N)** â€” one pass through the table to process each row.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** â€” depends on the number of rows and length of concatenated names.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Extra Notes:**

* In some databases (e.g., Oracle), string concatenation uses `||` instead of `CONCAT()`.
* In SQL Server, you can use:

```sql
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name
FROM patients;
```

* Handle `NULL` values carefully â€” `CONCAT()` treats `NULL` as an empty string in MySQL, but behavior can differ across DBMS.

---

If you want, I can also give a **version that handles NULL first names or last names gracefully** so the full name is never broken.
