Hereâ€™s a structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the `first_name` of all patients from the `patients` table whose first name **starts with the letter 'c'**.

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We need only the `first_name` column.
   * We want to filter names that start with `'c'`.
   * In SQL, pattern matching can be done using the `LIKE` operator with `%`.

2. **Use SQL SELECT statement:**

   * The `SELECT` clause specifies the column to retrieve.
   * The `FROM` clause specifies the table (`patients`).
   * The `WHERE` clause uses `LIKE 'c%'` to filter names starting with `'c'`.

     * `%` means any number of characters (including zero).

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name
FROM patients
WHERE first_name LIKE 'c%';
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* Without indexing on `first_name`: **O(N)** â€” full table scan is required.
* With a proper **B-Tree index** on `first_name`: **O(log N)** lookup for prefix searches (depends on DB engine).

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** â€” space required to store the output rows.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Extra Note:**

* SQL `LIKE` is **case-sensitive** in some databases (like PostgreSQL), but **case-insensitive** in others (like MySQL by default).
* If case-insensitive search is required, use functions like `LOWER(first_name) LIKE 'c%'` or database-specific collations.

If you want, I can also give you an **optimized version** of this query for faster searches on large datasets.
