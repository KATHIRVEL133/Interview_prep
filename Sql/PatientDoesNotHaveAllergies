Here’s a structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the first name and last name of all patients from the `patients` table who **do not have any recorded allergies** (`allergies` column is `NULL`).

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We need the columns: `first_name` and `last_name`.
   * We want to filter only those rows where `allergies` is **NULL** (no allergy information available).

2. **Use SQL SELECT statement:**

   * The `SELECT` clause specifies which columns to retrieve.
   * The `FROM` clause specifies the table (`patients`).
   * The `WHERE` clause uses `IS NULL` to filter rows where the `allergies` column has a NULL value.

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM patients
WHERE allergies IS NULL;
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* Without indexing: **O(N)** — full table scan required.
* With an index on `allergies`: depends on the database engine but generally improves performance for large datasets.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** — space needed to store the selected rows and columns in output.

---

If you want, I can also give you a **variation of this query** that checks for **both NULL and empty allergy information** in one step, which is often a practical requirement in real-world databases.
Do you want me to?
