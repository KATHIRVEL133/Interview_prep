Hereâ€™s a structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `height` of patient(s) with the **maximum height** from the `patients` table.

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We need the patient(s) with the tallest height.
   * Use a **subquery** to first find the maximum height.
   * Filter patients whose height equals this maximum height.

2. **Use SQL SELECT with subquery:**

   * Subquery: `(SELECT MAX(height) FROM patients)` gets the maximum height.
   * Outer query: selects details of patients whose height equals the maximum.

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, height
FROM patients
WHERE height = (SELECT MAX(height) FROM patients);
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* Without indexing: **O(N)** for subquery + **O(N)** for outer query â†’ **O(N)** overall (two full scans).
* With an index on `height`: subquery can be **O(1)** or **O(log N)**, improving efficiency.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** â€” space to store the result of matching rows.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Extra Notes:**

* This query can return **multiple patients** if more than one patient has the maximum height.
* For large datasets, itâ€™s more efficient to use a **window function** if your DBMS supports it:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, height
FROM (
    SELECT first_name, last_name, height, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY height DESC) AS rnk
    FROM patients
) sub
WHERE rnk = 1;
```

* Window functions avoid scanning the table twice and are more efficient for big datasets.

If you want, I can also give a **visual diagram showing how this subquery works** so itâ€™s easier to understand.
