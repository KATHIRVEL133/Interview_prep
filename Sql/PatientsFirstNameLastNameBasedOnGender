Here’s the structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the first name, last name, and gender of all patients whose gender is **male ('M')** from the `patients` table.

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We need specific columns: `first_name`, `last_name`, and `gender`.
   * We want only records where `gender = 'M'`.

2. **Use SQL SELECT statement:**

   * The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns to retrieve.
   * The `FROM` clause specifies the table (`patients`).
   * The `WHERE` clause filters the data based on the condition `gender = 'M'`.

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, gender
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'M';
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* SQL queries depend on the database engine and indexes.
* Without indexes: **O(N)** — where N is the number of rows in the table.
* With an index on `gender`: **O(log N)** in many cases due to index search efficiency.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** — proportional to the number of rows returned and the size of the selected columns.

---

If you want, I can also give you an **optimized approach** for this query using indexing to improve performance.
