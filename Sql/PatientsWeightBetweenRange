Hereâ€™s a structured note for your SQL query:

---

### **Problem Statement:**

Retrieve the `first_name` and `last_name` of all patients from the `patients` table whose **weight is between 100 and 120** (inclusive).

---

### **Solution Approach:**

1. **Understand the requirement:**

   * We need two columns: `first_name` and `last_name`.
   * We want only patients whose `weight` falls within the range `100` to `120`.
   * The SQL `BETWEEN` operator is ideal for range checks.

2. **Use SQL SELECT statement:**

   * The `SELECT` clause specifies the columns to retrieve.
   * The `FROM` clause specifies the table (`patients`).
   * The `WHERE` clause uses `BETWEEN 100 AND 120` to filter the range (inclusive).

3. **Final Query:**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM patients
WHERE weight BETWEEN 100 AND 120;
```

---

### **Time Complexity:**

* Without indexing: **O(N)** â€” full table scan needed to check every rowâ€™s `weight`.
* With an **index** on the `weight` column: **O(log N)** lookup time.

---

### **Space Complexity:**

* **O(result_size)** â€” proportional to the number of rows matching the condition and the size of selected columns.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Extra Note:**

* `BETWEEN` in SQL includes the boundary values by default (i.e., `100` and `120` are included).
* For exclusive range, use:

```sql
WHERE weight > 100 AND weight < 120;
```

---

If you want, I can also give a **real-world optimization** for this query for very large datasets with numeric range searches.
